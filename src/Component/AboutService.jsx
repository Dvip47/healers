                              Taking responsibility is not the same as blaming

                              downfall in the relationship. It’s about accepting

                              tough and triggering it can be to answer this

                              Many times, we don’t consciously think about who
                              we want to be; we just observe how our partner or
                              exes were and where you stood in that. Today, I
                              invite you to expand your mind to think about who
                              you want to be, because that’s how you’ll
                              naturally attract a great match. It was only in
                              2017 that I started to decide how I wanted to show
                              up in my relationships, which ultimately led me to
                              finding my match in early 2018. Yes, you can shift
                              your mind without changing who you are. This is
                              all about becoming aware of the life you want to
                              live, and what you’re no longer willing to settle
                              for. And, when you compare who you want to be with
                              what you were “handed” in your last relationship,
                              your ex doesn’t seem all that desirable.

                              takes more than they give. I find that the

                              relationship is a feeling of unworthiness.

                              start with 20. Feel free to keep going, and recite

                              Do you find most of your exes unfaithful? Do you
                              find they’re always the one leaving you first? Do
                              you find you date people who take your generosity
                              for granted? Do you find your exes treat you like
                              dirt? Get to know what pattern is showing up for
                              you so you can start gaining awareness. In my
                              experience, this is the FIRST step towards healing
                              and taking control during your breakup. When we
                              can pinpoint the pattern, we can begin to release
                              it.

                              Believe it or not, many people I speak with think
                              their ex has to do X or Y in order for them to let
                              go of how they feel. (Sound familiar?) This isn’t
                              the case. You don’t need them to apologize,
                              change, or do something for you to be a peace with
                              yourself.
